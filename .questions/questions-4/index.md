Q: What is the difference between defining and calling a function??

A: {This is when you create a function and specify what it does. It includes the function name, parameters (if any), and the block of code that runs when the function is called.This is when you execute the function by using its name followed by parentheses. This tells the program to run the code inside the function.}
